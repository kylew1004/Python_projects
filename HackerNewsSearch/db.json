Because of the sheer amount of data, it\u2019s an interesting problem, but you could generally work with the researchers to impose good I&#x2F;O behavior that gets around the POSIX constraints peculiarities of the particular filesystems. You want 100,000,000 cpu hours on a $200M computer? You can do the work to make the filesystem writes easier on the system.</p><p>Coming into private industry was a real eye-opener. You\u2019re in-house staff and you don\u2019t get to say who can use the computer. People use the filesystems for IPC, store 100M files of 200B each, read() and write() terabytes of data 1B at a time, you name it. If I had $100 for every job in which I saw 10,000 cores running a stat() in a while loop waiting for some data to get written to it by one process that had long since died, I\u2019d be retired on a beach somewhere.</p><p>The problem with POSIX I&#x2F;O is that it\u2019s so, so easy and it almost always works when you expect it to. GPFS (what I\u2019m most familiar with) is amazing at enforcing the consistency. I\u2019ve seen parallel filesystems and disk break in every imaginable way and in a lot of ways that aren\u2019t, but I\u2019ve never seen GPFS present data inconsistently across time where some write call was finished and it\u2019s data didn\u2019t show up to a read() started after the write got its lock or a situation where some process opened a file after the unlink was acknowledged. For a developer who hasn\u2019t ever worked with parallel computing and whose boss just wants them to make it work, the filesystem is an amazing tool. I honestly can\u2019t blame a developer who makes it work for 1000 cores and then gets upset with me when it blows up at 1500. I get grouchy with them, but I don\u2019t blame them. (There\u2019s a difference!)</p><p>But as the filesystems get bigger, the amount of work the filesystems have to do to maintain that consistency isn\u2019t scaling. The amount of lock traffic flying back and forth between all the nodes is a lot of complexity to keep up with, and if you have the tiniest issue with your network even on some edge somewhere, you\u2019re going to have a really unpleasant day.</p><p>One of the things that GCE and AWS have done so well is to just abandon the concept of the shared POSIX filesystem, and produce good tooling to help people deal with the IPC and workflow data processing without it. It\u2019s a hell of a lot of work to go from an on-site HPC environment to GCE though. There\u2019s a ton of money to be made for someone who can make that transition easier and cheaper (if you\u2019ve got it figured out, you know, call me. I want to on it!), but people have sunk so much money into their parallel filesystems and disk that it\u2019s a tough ask for the C-suite. Hypothetically speaking, someone I know really well who\u2019s a lot like me was recently leading a project to do exactly this that got shut down basically because they couldn\u2019t prove it would be cheaper in 3 years.</p>", "points": null, "parent_id": 18327524, "story_id": 18321937, "children": [{"id": 18331312, "created_at": "2018-10-29T20:53:39.000Z", "created_at_i": 1540846419, "type": "comment", "author": "KaiserPro", "title": null, "url": null, "text": "<p>This is a lovely wedge of experience.</p><p>You are of course very correct that if you have a massive number of processes using files for IPC, things will fail in very strange ways.</p><p>One of the very positive things that AWS&#x2F;GCE provide is simple scalable primitives, with obvious metrics to measure limits.

To make significant profits, we need to sell services on top of our software products (this is essentially GBS and their &quot;strong&quot; sales people)2. To make very good profits, we need to make highly customizable software (for example AI and BI offerings).3. To make even more profit we need to make sure the software is tuned to the hardware we make.If one of those weakens the entire IBM portfolio and profits weaken dramatically.Here's problems in last 7 years tho:\n1. People moving to the cloud so the hardware business flatlines.\n2. Because people moved to the cloud they found replacements to IBM software.\n3. At the end of the day IBM is forced to deliver professional services on top of other companies' software and hardware (and services employees are not cheap).At some point the IBM execs must have had an epiphany that their AI offerings don't sell because they don't have a platform that sells other commodity cloud services on top of which AI components can be sold as high-priced addons.So thus IBM decided to do what it does best --- take control of the entire stack.With this acquisition IBM has the potential to become a next gen. cloud vendor. For example IBM has been trying to sell Bluemix as a hybrid PaaS/IaaS but haven't been very successful.

All big businesses are buying layer after layer of different markets reducing the number of options that one can choose.* <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/contributes-linux-kernel/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://thenewstack.io/contributes-linux-kernel/</a>* <a href=\"https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/ibm-acquire-red-hat-completely-changing-cloud-landscape-and-becoming-world%E2%80%99s-1-hybrid-cloud-provider\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/ibm-acquire-r...</a>", "points": null, "parent_id": 18321884, "story_id": 18321884, "children": [{"id": 18323720, "created_at": "2018-10-28T22:55:24.000Z", "created_at_i": 1540767324, "type": "comment", "author": "z3t4", "title": null, "url": null, "text": "<p>What is a better business model then taking something that is free, and renting it at a premium ...</p>", "points": null, "parent_id": 18322548, "story_id": 18321884, "children": [], "options": []}, {"id": 18323019, "created_at": "2018-10-28T20:40:15.000Z", "created_at_i": 1540759215, "type": "comment", "author": "onetimemanytime", "title": null, "url": null, "text": "<p>&gt;&gt;<i>IBM has been historically a Linux contributor.</i></p><p>Maybe, but IBM has been historically a for profit enterprise, required to appease investors every quarter (or the CEO goes, stock crashes etc.)</p><p>They may have contributed to projects to then sell services, but make no mistake, IBM has their own interests at heart, not yours.</p>", "points": null, "parent_id": 18322548, "story_id": 18321884, "children": [{"id": 18323528, "created_at": "2018-10-28T22:07:48.000Z", "created_at_i": 1540764468, "type": "comment", "author": "jotm", "title": null, "url": null, "text": "<p>I see way too many good open source projects relying on donations, and they are not doing well.

Fellow IBMer :) sorry to hear about your experience so far, just wanted to chime in and say that you&#x27;re definitely not alone with this perspective. Patents at IBM are so highly valued that they often act as a blinder towards open source.</p><p>However, there are definitely groups inside of IBM that choose to open source their work instead of filing for patents. For example, the team that I&#x27;m currently on works on the Carbon Design System [0], which is entirely open source. All the work our team does is out in the open too [1][2], which is great!</p><p>I would say that for teams like this, the tendency is to open source software and patent processes that are unique to IBM or a particular domain. That way we can try and contribute back as much useful technology as we can!</p><p>Obviously there are others at the company who might have a different perspective, but thankfully we&#x27;re also trying to spread our own take on alternatives to the traditional processes at IBM.</p><p>Hope this info can help make your time at IBM a little bit better!</p><p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.carbondesignsystem.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.carbondesignsystem.com&#x2F;</a>\n[1]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;carbon-design-system\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;carbon-design-system</a>\n[2]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;IBM?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=carbon&amp;type=&amp;language=\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;IBM?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=carbon&amp;type=&amp;languag...</a></p>", "points": null, "parent_id": 18322592, "story_id": 18321884, "children": [{"id": 18324598, "created_at": "2018-10-29T02:35:55.000Z", "created_at_i": 1540780555, "type": "comment", "author": "ajdlinux", "title": null, "url": null, "text": "<p>I&#x27;m in the Linux Technology Centre - we&#x27;ve got an extremely strong open source culture over here.</p>", "points": null, "parent_id": 18323711, "story_id": 18321884, "children": [], "options": []}], "options": []}], "options": []}, {"id": 18323362, "created_at": "2018-10-28T21:35:17.000Z", "created_at_i": 1540762517, "type": "comment", "author": "bitL", "title": null, "url": null, "text": "What has just happened??Was there some behind-the-door takeover, from a friend to a friend?

But with the introduction of RedHat they get new &quot;blood&quot; as it were. Who knows, what if they make the CEO of RedHat the CEO of IBM a la Satya Nadella and Microsoft?They have said that RedHat would remain an independent part of IBM as part of their cloud push. Let's take them at their word unless they prove us wrong.

Encrypted messaging services in particular are poison to an org that&#x27;s trying to stop employees exfiltrating valuable data. Google can just about do a good job of it because it has an essentially unlimited budget, which it spends on rolling its own tools for absolutely everything and integrating it all into one uber-architecture. From an economics perspective this makes no sense - comparative advantage etc - and thus basically no other company can do it that way. They have to buy or deploy open source tools that use a wide array of threat models and security systems but 95% of them will assume a trusted admin.

However in our case it was a single obscure &quot;Colin was here&quot; tweet.We had recently built an internal endpoint in one of the backend apps that takes a string and publishes it straight to the main breaking news Twitter account. This was integrated with a custom UI tool that the news desk people used to quickly break a story across TV, Twitter, the website etc with one click.I had a suspicion that this endpoint was how that tweet was published, but could not prove it. Many thoughts were going through my head.. \u201cis this an internal job, or did someone hack our backend system and somehow figured this out etc.. \u201cWe quickly returned to our desks, and straight away I greped our logs for &quot;tweeting&quot; as I developed that feature and was sure we logged that when the endpoint is called, but in the heat of the moment forgot that to \u201c-i\u201d as it the log message actually contained &quot;Tweeting&quot; (which cost us a few minutes). In the meantime there was panic around the business, people were putting out PR statements just in case it was a real hack, the tweet was deleted etc.Finally, with help from colleagues, we tracked down a &quot;Tweeting&quot; log message around the same time the tweet was published along with the HTTP request source IP, and traced it (just like in movies) to our secondary news studio in Central London. This is when one of the managers shouted &quot;I know a Colin who works there, he's a testing team manager!&quot;.We gave Colin a ring to understand what was going on, he had no idea about any of this but said he was doing some DR testing earlier of all tools that editors use, and wasn\u2019t really aware this would go out. As you can imagine, it could have been much worse.The entertaining bit was the 30 minutes of fame this mysterious Colin enjoyed on the internet, where many people were worried about the welfare of &quot;Colin&quot;, and it was picked up by various [1] news [2] websites.[1] <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/lukelewis/an-important-history-of-the-colin-was-here-meme-that-changed\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.buzzfeed.com/lukelewis/an-important-history-of-t...</a>\n[2] <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/lukelewis/an-important-history-of-the-colin-was-here-meme-that-changed\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.buzzfeed.com/lukelewis/an-important-history-of-t...</a>", "points": null, "parent_id": 23851275, "story_id": 23851275, "children": [], "options": []}, {"id": 23853011, "created_at": "2020-07-15T22:24:10.000Z", "created_at_i": 1594851850, "type": "comment", "author": "sleepyshift", "title": null, "url": null, "text": "In an attempt to mitigate the damage, Twitter appears to have blocked verified accounts from sending tweets.", "points": null, "parent_id": 23851275, "story_id": 23851275, "children": [], "options": []}, {"id": 23854291, "created_at": "2020-07-16T00:30:14.000Z", "created_at_i": 1594859414, "type": "comment", "author": "koolba", "title": null, "url": null, "text": "Did they send one out from Trump as well?

People can pay whatever respect that they want. Incidentally I do like the way you posed that question. In a  respectful way and not attacking as some of the other comments (as well as replies on a similar comment I made). People who say things like &#x27;so what have you done???&#x27;. Like unless you are that great nothing you say matters you peon. I find it strange when people will defend a person like Allen and trash someone (like me) who simply states an opinion when we know that Allen would not have given any of us the time of day or cared about us in any way.

They would and will do anything to squash competition (Netscape only one example) that they could. Antitrust lawsuit by government. Etc.  So the money that Allen used came from that company and that way of doing business.. Fine. I don&#x27;t take a position on that just to stop lionizing the guy as if he is some kind of saint.  Noting also that he is being celebrated not because he died and gave money away but because he was linked to a tech company that we all know (and some of us hate). That&#x27;s all. When does HN talk about this type of thing? So the irony is that he had a very small part of the money that Msft made over the years that he gave away. He didn&#x27;t work there for that long. And guess what? Despite what anyone thinks he is not 10 times as great (just like Woz) than dozens of people on HN who were simply not in the right place at the right time.

Part of that may be irrational sentiment, but part of it -- IMHO -- is because after a grace period, society is generally OK with criticizing the dead into perpetuity. For example, the world (and HN) seemed nearly unanimous in grieving Steve Jobs in the days&#x2F;weeks after his untimely death. But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s at all unpopular nowadays to talk about what a showboating insensitive asshole he is said to have been (e.g. Lisa Jobs&#x27;s recent memoir).</p>", "points": null, "parent_id": 18233555, "story_id": 18224227, "children": [{"id": 18241363, "created_at": "2018-10-17T17:32:04.000Z", "created_at_i": 1539797524, "type": "comment", "author": "gist", "title": null, "url": null, "text": "<p>&gt; (e.g. Lisa Jobs&#x27;s recent memoir)</p><p>I do not feel bad for Lisa Jobs one iota.

Note that Lisa regardless of whether she got any of Steve&#x27;s money did get a benefit from being associated with him. That is more than the rest of the people in the world with a parental situation of various types get. So I do not feel sorry for her and that even assumes the nominal tails that she told are even true.  Guess what? My Dad is gruff as well. I learned to deal with it. I don&#x27;t think I am unique in that respect. And I wasn&#x27;t around much for my kids growing up. They were not impacted by it.</p><p>Secondly I honestly don&#x27;t care if Steve was an insensitive asshole. Plenty of nobodies have to deal with this type of person and nobody will even care to listen to them. They will say &#x27;yeah my boss is a dick as well&#x27;. And then they will be on to the next topic. Not only that but the truth is nobody is forced to work for Steve and if you get to the point in life of working for Steve you can work anywhere.

Most people will not agree with this because they think he could be both the creative guy that he was and nice and calm at the same time.</p><p>True about the grace period. However the exception to that is a direct attack on someone close to you in order to defend someone who is not even close or related to you. It goes like this: You are talking to a good friend, a co-worker, relative and so on. They hold a view that is different than yours on a topic. So fine tell them what you think and be honest. But don&#x27;t do it in a way that screams &#x27;you are wrong for the way you feel and you suck&#x27;. Don&#x27;t get angry and don&#x27;t get mad at them. Why? If not obvious because they are close to you and the topic or person you are discussing is not.

Sure now he looks like &#x27;older wise guy who helps mankind&#x27; but he really did anything and everything in order to get whatever business he could at the expense of anyone. I am not once again saying that he shouldn&#x27;t have done that.  But he was not a nice guy and Msft was not a &#x27;nice&#x27; corporation and by the way the amount of aggravation that OS created was truly staggering.  How many people suffered because of that crap that they turned out?

It was a rare balance and Paul Allen knew how to create the conditions for innovation and novel research breakthroughs with micromanaging.Additionally, Paul Allen was an advocate for open science. Through AI2 he directly supported arxiv.org and funded the development of Semantic Scholar. I had an opportunity to participate in a gathering of scientists, academics and publishers organized by Vulcan and the Allen Institutes to investigate innovations to support open science. Alexandra Elbakyan (founder of Scihub) was skyped in (technically on the run) to share her advocacy of accessible and open science. It was surprising and inspiring to see that Paul Allen provided Alexendra a platform to share her experience (especially as several major publishers were in attendance).His lasting legacy in AI will be the support of Semantic Scholar and the Alexandria (common sense) project. In neuroscience research, AIBs has made major breakthroughs in mapping the mouse brain and producing prolific open datasets (Allen Brain Atlas) to support research.In Seattle, it was hard to not run into the influence of Paul Allen. From the Seattle Seahawks to the Museum of Popular Culture (MoPoP), Paul Allen had an impact everywhere in Seattle.It is sad to see him pass away.

At that point, they have every incentive to add proprietary functionality for the sole purpose of making interoperability difficult. Which could prevent a new competitor from entering the market what would invent a new email workflow that would save you a further 10 minutes every day.

A centralized power structure is when power is concentrated in the hands of a few. The fact that there are other forms of &quot;centralization&quot; is completely besides the point. If anything, the point is that you can often have those other forms of (useful) centralization without the centralization of power. Newsgroups, for example, obviously centralize discussion, in that they bring people who share an interest together in one (virtual) place.

It&#x27;s ultimately a non-sequitur: Millions of companies independently host websites on this planet, but obviously you don&#x27;t visit millions of websites and ask the search function on each one of them your question of the day. You simply use one of a number of search engines, whichever one you prefer for your own needs, and no matter which search engine you choose to use, you will be searching pretty much the exact same set of websites. There is simply no need to centralize the power to control what can be published on the web or how the web works with one hosting company in order to have one central location that you can use to navtigate it all.</p><p>You don&#x27;t need centralization of power in order to have centralization of access.</p>", "points": null, "parent_id": 17224060, "story_id": 17221527, "children": [{"id": 17224714, "created_at": "2018-06-04T04:42:01.000Z", "created_at_i": 1528087321, "type": "comment", "author": "AaronFriel", "title": null, "url": null, "text": "<p>&gt; You don&#x27;t need centralization of power in order to have centralization of access.</p><p>It isn&#x27;t necessary, but it is sufficient and that seems to be enough for a lot of folks.

Github is nice on its own, but business wise they haven\u2019t been profitable, so sooner or later some change had to happen. In my experience, Github is great for public code storage and small private projects (easy to manage developers that already have github accounts), but it does become pretty expensive and I don\u2019t necessarily think the ROI is worth it compared to a self-hosted solution. For opensource and personal portfolios, the \u201cnetwork effect\u201d or first mover advantage sort of set the stage for github\u2019s popularity over gitlab, but for a paid enterprise solution I think gitlab does a better job and offers more value per dollar. Partially what sucks is having to have separate github/gitlab accounts/repositories since that\u2019s now 2 things to manage. I\u2019ve tried codecommit and bitbucket as well, but those were kinda meh (in my opinion).Typically when \u201cthe Microsoft touch\u201d is added it\u2019s for the worse, so the expectations bar is pretty low. But who knows. I can definitely see them leveraging github to further go after AWS by giving Azure a leg up over codecommit. VSCode has also been pretty good, if they add in the \u201csocial integrations\u201d of github to VSCode that also competes against Cloud9 on AWS. Right now AWS is solidly winning the cloud race, but if this puts price/service competitive pressure on amazon I won\u2019t complain.I also wonder what will happen with all the code and personal data from github. I really don\u2019t want to have to make a microsoft account to access github.

It's a social network for a service that does not need to be a social network. The small git hosting services that existed before GitHub got huge were just fine.

Assuming I can even understand your poorly constructed point, I still disagree with it (see #1 and #2) and, more importantly, think you fundamentally misunderstand the landscape in which Microsoft now competes.

They have oriented their entire organization around Azure (its biggest revenue growth area) and cross-platform applications deliverable in the browser and on 3rd party mobile OSes. They reorganized and, for the first time, no longer have a Windows division. Thinking they&#x27;re in the middle of some Machiavellian scheme to take back an increasingly irrelevant OS dominance position by extinguishing Linux (and failing because Linux is too big?) completely misses the point that Linux&#x27;s size wasn&#x27;t the cause of Microsoft&#x27;s inability to extinguish it, it was these other countervailing industry forces.

It was best GitHub automation WITH results ever!3\ufe0f\u20e3\u2014 Don't &quot;@&quot; me coz I know about @Microsoft's history with #OpenSource.

Taking it lightly in 2018 would be tomfoolery.5\ufe0f\u20e3\u2014 I've been most inspired by teams behind \ud83c\udd9a@Code (@auchenberg ) and @Azure \u2014 I think that @JeffSand has built an incredible team of @AzureAdvocates folks like @ashleymcnamara @sarah_edo @jawache @burkeholland @simona_cotin @_clarkio @John_Papa @holtbt @film_girl @TommyLee6\ufe0f\u20e3\u2014I'm a big fan of &quot;Dev Experience&quot; (DX) that's why I pay $200 for a font I use in \ud83c\udd9aCode &amp; have built s of #OpenSource dev-tooling github.com/ahmadawais\u2014Teams at @Azure are doing a lot to make DX better for the cloud \u2192 @AzureFunctions + @Code integration is impressive!7\ufe0f\u20e3\u2014 GitHub's been struggling to find a new CEO for a year. What if? \nIt's my primary code hosting company. It's helped me go full-time open source with the support from awesome dev community/companies. Safe to say that @GitHub has made #OpenSource better8\ufe0f\u20e3\u2014 @Microsoft has done a lot for #OpenSource in the last 4 years with @SatyaNadella.\ud83c\udd9a @Code's love.\n @Linux Subsystem on @Windows.\n Draft.sh for @kubernetesio didn't have a Windows version and still offers @MacHomebrew as the go-to way of installing it!9\ufe0f\u20e3\u2014@GitHub is not exactly a cash-cow. @Microsoft has put money where their mouth is \u2014 out of 1.5 Million organizations on GitHub MSFT has most GitHub contributors to its repos, it's the biggest company with over 1000 employees contributing code to GitHub \u2192proof of good faith!\u2014 I think @Microsoft is changing for good. The intent here's to connect with developers and not offend them by disrupting a good company. MSFT won't change a lot but this acquisition might make GitHub a lot better. Also, MSFT will jump into ROR. It's high time for #OpenSource.What are your thoughts on this whole thing?!\nPeace! \ufe0f", "points": null, "parent_id": 17221527, "story_id": 17221527, "children": [], "options": []}, {"id": 17223860, "created_at": "2018-06-04T01:47:18.000Z", "created_at_i": 1528076838, "type": "comment", "author": "siavosh", "title": null, "url": null, "text": "Are there any projects in the &quot;blockchain&quot; / &quot;decentralize everything&quot; industry that's tackling the source control problem?", "points": null, "parent_id": 17221527, "story_id": 17221527, "children": [], "options": []}, {"id": 17224628, "created_at": "2018-06-04T04:26:14.000Z", "created_at_i": 1528086374, "type": "comment", "author": "simonebrunozzi", "title": null, "url": null, "text": "Future often rhymes with the past (Skype).", "points": null, "parent_id": 17221527, "story_id": 17221527, "children": [], "options": []}, {"id": 17221814, "created_at": "2018-06-03T20:44:26.000Z", "created_at_i": 1528058666, "type": "comment", "author": "ttoinou", "title": null, "url": null, "text": "<pre><code>   Microsoft [...] is now one if the biggest contributors to GitHub\n\n</code></pre>\nCitation needed ?", "points": null, "parent_id": 17221527, "story_id": 17221527, "children": [{"id": 17221937, "created_at": "2018-06-03T20:56:12.000Z", "created_at_i": 1528059372, "type": "comment", "author": "golf1052", "title": null, "url": null, "text": "<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;octoverse.github.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;octoverse.github.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;</a> under Organizations with the most open source contributors</p>", "points": null, "parent_id": 17221814, "story_id": 17221527, "children": [], "options": []}], "options": []}, {"id": 17228470, "created_at": "2018-06-04T15:10:17.000Z", "created_at_i": 1528125017, "type": "comment", "author": "cdnh22", "title": null, "url": null, "text": "What are the goals Microsoft wants to achieve with this?", "points": null, "parent_id": 17221527, "story_id": 17221527, "children": [], "options": []}, {"id": 17221560, "created_at": "2018-06-03T20:20:06.000Z", "created_at_i": 1528057206, "type": "comment", "author": "madspindel", "title": null, "url": null, "text": "Tbh, I like this move.

It is _probably_ viable for a very powerful adversary (such as the NSA) to successfully trick someone working with binary blobs, like firmware for a black box. You can imagine a developer who (unusually) assiduously checks the firmware they&#x27;re provided to see that it works as intended, then uploads a new version to github, and the NSA trap is sprung, they substitute a modification with the same hash but different firmware that, perhaps, causes your billion dollar spy satellite to point its cameras at the sun, destroying it.</p><p>But if the developer is less assiduous this was all pointless, just send the &quot;burn spy sat&quot; firmware to the original developer and lie.</p><p>Or if the spy camera owners decide not to take this mysterious last-minute update, or they try it on their ground-based prototype first to check it works... bzzt, your hugely expensive SHA-1 trick was a waste of time.</p><p>Yes, SHA-1 is broken. Nobody should use it for anything new, and things that already use it should have been migrating already _before_ the official announcement from Google et al. But, Merkle-Damgard hashes have done this before, and will do it again, and so we know how this goes. You get a collision but don&#x27;t get anything else, critically you don&#x27;t get second-pre-image.</p><p>This means, the NSA doesn&#x27;t gain a way to substitute other stuff in a repo. They can only _collide_ their own things, by carefully choosing the inputs. So a plan where you just replace the _real_ firmware can&#x27;t work.</p><p>Also, the nature of this MD attacks smashes up the input state, which for git will usually be source code. A mysterious anonymous contributor is surprising enough, but when their proposed patch adds dozens of bytes of what seems to be binary noise, you know something is up. That&#x27;s why my example attack above involved firmware, where this might be less suspicious.</p><p>So yes, Git should have transitioned off SHA-1, and a window of opportunity for bad guys does exist, but it&#x27;s not the sort of gaping window you imagine.</p>", "points": null, "parent_id": 17222343, "story_id": 17221527, "children": [], "options": []}], "options": []}], "options": []}], "options": []}, {"id": 17221768, "created_at": "2018-06-03T20:39:41.000Z", "created_at_i": 1528058381, "type": "comment", "author": "clu3l355", "title": null, "url": null, "text": "<p>I had a pretty similar experience with skype.

EU laws required you to inform visitors about &quot;cookies&quot; and have them acknowledge them long before GDPR passed into law.Second, it's not about third parties or required cookies vs. marketing cookies.What the law actually states is that you may not, in any form, make individuals using your service identifiable or track them without prior informed and active consent by the visitor, and you also may not make such consent mandatory for accessing your publications content. plain and simple.all the &quot;cookie banners&quot; out there are ONE form of solving this problem but are in no way mandated by law. If you find another way of solving this issue, all the better.But the way these banners are designed and implemented at large are geared towards soliciting consent by means of obfuscating actual selection (think: bright &quot;accept all&quot; buttons with tiny &quot;save settings&quot; links) and by making it hard and tedious to actually select and submit your preferences (think: giant lists of all trackers with opt-out for legitimate interest and optin for consent side by side). These are in clear violation of what the law states imho and are largely in use because there is still no juridical precedent that clarifies what goes and what doesn't.what we are experiencing is a clash of ethical mandate and economical interest. GDPR is aimed at protecting you, the user, from beeing identified and tracked along your wen history, be it by cookies or fingerprint or whatever.dropping functional cookies for logged in users is perfectly fine though, as registration itself is likely a process where users can be informed of such personal identification and is an active decision by the user.saying &quot;the site needs it to function&quot; and tracking users first party only is NOT a way around GDPR, as much as this narrative gets retold.in short: it's not about cookies and third parties.

The rule applies to all non-essential cookies regardless of whether the cookies collect personal data or are used for tracking. The rule does not cover cookieless server-side tracking of users.

GDPR increased the power of the DPAs to issue fines of up to 4% of annual turnover.

You are still tracking and may share the data with 3rd parties.  Justification: privacy statement [0] line 147.  It states that data are &quot;aggregated, non-personally identified&quot; which <i>might</i> mean it&#x27;s GDPR compliant.  OTOH: you&#x27;re presumably holding the non-aggregated data for aggregation purposes in the first place.  IANAL but I think that needs consent.

So I deleted all cookies that Github had given me (which was 12) and refreshed the page. As expected, I was now logged out and Github immediately issued you me 4 new cookies.</p><p><pre><code>  \u2022 _gh_sess (a fresh session cookie)\n\n  \u2022 _octo (not sure what this is, might have something to do with cache-busting? Looks like it contains something resembling a version id&#x2F;string)\n\n  \u2022 logged_in (my logged in status, now false)\n\n  \u2022 tz (my timezone)\n</code></pre>\nAll of these are valid cookies (assuming that _octo is for cache busting) that would not require a cookie banner.</p><p>So then I logged in. I now have 10 cookies. None of them appear to be tracking cookies.</p><p><pre><code>  \u2022 __Host-user_session_same_site (14 day session token)\n\n  \u2022 device_id (this contains a random string to differentiate this device. Initially I was concerned with this, thinking it might be a fingerprint. But it is far too short for that, and it appears to be a flash cookie. It expires as soon as it is issued, so it only lasts one request. This is likely used to improve your experience in the case that you are logged in across multiple devices to differentiate which device is making a request within the current session)\n\n  \u2022 gh_sess (same as before, session)\n\n  \u2022 _octo (same as before, presumably cache-busting)\n\n  \u2022 dotcom_user (contains a string with my github username)\n\n  \u2022 has_recent_activity (boolean value, likely used to display &quot;unseen notifications&quot; on the front-end)\n\n  \u2022 logged_in (same as before, except now true)\n\n  \u2022 tz (same as before, timezone for frontend time displays)\n\n  \u2022 tz (now have 2 timezone cookies. Both are currently the same timezone, although I assume the first one is a timezone gathered from my system clock and the new one is a timezone gathered from my github settings which they now have since I logged in. This is probably a bug where they expect to overwrite the first one, but since one is set to the github.com domain and the other is set to all github subdomains then it didn&#x27;t overwrite)\n\n  \u2022 user_session (yet another session token with 14 day expiration. However the session token in this cookie and the __Host-user_session_same_site cookie are the same. Not sure reason for the duplication)\n</code></pre>\nSo those are all the cookies that Github now gives you. 2 of these seem to have duplicates. Meaning the same could be done with 8 cookies instead of 10. But regardless, all cookies seem to check out. None of these are tracking your usage and are there to improve your logged in experience. Tracking things like your username and recent activity boolean are most likely being used to save making the same database queries for every request. The others are just tracking sessions, which is something that users definitely do want. The 14 day expiration is a good middle ground between convenience and security.</p><p>At the beginning I mentioned that I had two tracking cookies before I cleared my cookies. These are gone after the refresh. So it looks like github has in fact stopped issuing tracking cookies altogether. They also seem to have removed Google Analytics entirely as I don&#x27;t see the script on their website at all.</p><p>So all-in-all this definitely checks out.

He was boosting profits through repeated layoffs and price squeezing. It had just bought my former employer (Nokia&#x27;s phone business) without a clear strategy. Windows Phone was already failing in the market due to a series of strategic blunders, arrogance, and poor product positioning and platform strategy. Windows 7 and 8 had largely flopped in the market with lackluster adoption for the same reason. The cloud business was heavily windows focused and not an easy sell either: same reason. Meanwhile developers were jumping ship in favor of Apple laptops and Linux servers, android&#x2F;ios phones, and standards based web applications on top of Chrome and Firefox.</p><p>I grew up in the nineties; things were different then. Visual Studio was the go to product for many developers and developing on windows was a given. Macs didn&#x27;t become useful as developer machines until a decade later and Linux was a something you ran in your closet or on a old hand me down PC (been there done that). That changed under Ballmer&#x27;s rule and he failed to adapt.

By embracing linux and open source, and by turning Azure into a very competitive product that mostly runs Linux. He just took Edge out the back and shot it as well.</p><p>The net result of all this is that he re-established MS as a company that appeals to developers because despite his famous Mantra, developers were running away under Ballmer. VS Code, having SQL Server supported on linux, supporting Linux and contributing to it, embracing the wider C# ecosystem outside of the Windows silo, buying Github, etc. are all clever moves that rebuilt lost trust. All these things were unthinkable under Ballmer. Even Windows 10 is starting to look pretty nice to people like me with it&#x27;s linux subsystem, Docker support, and nice hardware options.</p><p>As a consequence they have a lot of healthy growth in their cloud business because developers take them serious again.

Having everything in the same UI is also really useful, which is another win for Gitlab.I prefer Github's UI for overall repo exploration and issues, etc.. but I'm not sure if I'll move my private repos over to Github now that's it free, because the repo itself is only 1 piece of the puzzle.Microsoft also has a deep connection with Docker.

There are multiple things that I don&#x27;t like about it, such as the way it handles registry images, but overall my experience for these 3 years has been terrific.</p><p>First and foremost, Gitlab CI is the best experience I have ever had, and I can compare it with Travis and Codeship; Gitlab is way ahead of every platform in terms of convenience and its free-tier limits. They have their own shared runners, which means you can run as many parallel jobs as there are runners available at the moment, so no concurrency limit there. They also allow you to run the free stuff for 2000 minutes per month, which is more then enough for most of the side projects. Also, you can use your own runners with the free tier as well, which means just pick a 5$ VM from DO, install the gitlab-runner using the package manager of the OS, such as apt or yum, and register its address on Gitlab UI. The whole runner stuff takes around 10-15 minutes to setup, and you are good to go. You can have as many runners as you like and you can run as many jobs as you like on them as well. There are also options to setup gitlab-runner in such way that it spans new VMs for jobs, which means you don&#x27;t even need to have full-time runners, they can be created on demand. Also, CI is completely configured via a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, which is version controlled and has a clear syntax, I have found it the easiest to use among the other options. It syncs with issues, merge requests and the project tree, which means you can reach to the corresponding pipeline from the MR; it also allows you to generate artifacts and store them for a certain amount of time available for download. Overall, I am a huge fan of Gitlab CI, I couldn&#x27;t have imagined it would be this convenient to use the same product for Git-hosting and continuous integration, it is a real pleasure.</p><p>They also have their own Docker registry, which is pretty convenient to use with CI builds. I use it to push my images with commit hashes as tags to this registry from CI. Unfortunately, there is a lot of room for improvement for registry interface, currently it is pretty basic, meaning it only lists the image tags. If you are pushing the images per commit basis, you are gonna have a lot of images and cleaning up the repository is impossible from the interface, which is sad. I really hope they improve the registry integration. They also have some Kubernetes and monitoring integration which allows you to monitor your cluster and deployments from Gitlab interface directly, but I haven&#x27;t used it yet, so no comments there.</p><p>Apart from the feature set, the most important reason I choose Gitlab over Github is clear communication they maintain. Downtimes happen, engineering teams can have bad times, but they are always open about these problems. They inform everyone from a Twitter account, they are responsive to everyone, and you can see them being very clear and direct about the problems they are having. I expect downtimes to happen, Git-hosting is not a crucial system for me that I cannot live with an hour of downtime, maybe it is because of the scale of the projects I am working with, but having an open conversation about issues like this is the actual value for me. As long as they keep this level of communication, I am fine with occasional downtimes. Not that they have downtimes all the time, but it is true that I have seen more downtimes on Gitlab than on Github.</p><p>Overall, the reason I&#x27;d not migrate my private projects to Github is not Gitlab having free private repositories, but their huge feature set and level of communication. I see Github as a giant corporation, and Gitlab as some guys like myself, I feel closer to them and I&#x27;ll be their user &amp; customer as longs as I feel that way. I have no association with Gitlab at all, I am just a happy user and I wanted to explain why I like Gitlab, I think a lot of people would choose Gitlab over Github if publicity is not a concern.</p>", "points": null, "parent_id": 18848736, "story_id": 18847043, "children": [{"id": 18856035, "created_at": "2019-01-08T15:17:57.000Z", "created_at_i": 1546960677, "type": "comment", "author": "dsumenkovic", "title": null, "url": null, "text": "<p>Hey, I wanted to express the same enthusiasm as sytse.
